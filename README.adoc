== Purpose

A seq2seq transformer suited for transliteration. Written in Ruby.

Secryst was originally built for the
https://www.interscript.com[Interscript project]
(https://github.com/secryst/secryst[at GitHub]).

The goal is to allow:

* Developers to train models and provide the trained model to users. In order to to train models, raw computing and their bindings can be used, e.g. OpenCL.

* Users of the library in Ruby who only want to "use" the trained models should not require special bindings to run.


== Prerequisites

* `libtorch` (1.6.0)
* `fftw`
* `gsl`
* `lapack`
* `openblas`


On Ubuntu:

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo apt-get -y install libfftw3-dev libgsl-dev libopenblas-dev \
    liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev unzip automake make gcc g++ \
    libtorch libtorch-dev
$ wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu102/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-1.6.0.zip
$ unzip libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-1.6.0.zip

$ gem install bundler -v "~> 2"
$ bundle config build.torch-rb \
    --with-torch-dir=$(pwd)/libtorch

$ bundle install
----


On macOS:

[source,sh]
----
$ brew install libtorch gsl lapack openblas fftw automake gcc

$ gem install bundler -v "~> 2"
$ bundle config build.numo-linalg \
    --with-openblas-dir=/usr/local/opt/openblas \
    --with-lapack-lib=/usr/local/opt/lapack

$ bundle install
----


NOTE: (for macOS)
If you mistakenly installed `numo-linalg` without the above configuration
options, please uninstall it with these steps and configure the bundle as
described above:

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle exec gem uninstall numo-linalg
----

== Origin of name

Scrying is the practice of peering into a crystal sphere for fortune telling.
The purpose of `seq2seq` is nearly like scrying: looking into a crystal sphere
for some machine-learning magic to happen.

"`Secryst`" comes from the combination of "`seq2seq`" + "`crystal`" + "`scrying`".
